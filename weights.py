#You can calculate an individual's weight on another planet by multiplying their weight times the relative surface gravity of the other world.

#Weight on Other Planet = Weight on Earth x Multiple of Earthâ€™s Gravity

#Design a Python program that asks a user for their name and weight. The program will greet the user by name and then calculate/display the user's weight on the other planets.
#Each item should be displayed on a line by itself.

print("Greetings")
name = input("What is your name? ")
